# RecurrNet_Sp22

This repository provides all relevant software and files, with the exception of R Version XXX, to re-create the findings in Chapter 14 of my dissertation. In this project I trained a recurrent neural network on artificial languages to simulate empirical findings with adult and child readers investigating the dynamics of morphological processing during visual word recognition. 

The first folder, "training", contains the neural network software Lens, used for training and testing (for more information and instructions for using Lens, see https://ni.cmu.edu/~plaut/Lens/Manual/). It also contains two sets of files relevant to network training: one for a more morphologically rich langage (14t4i2o-language) and one for a more morphologically impoverished language (8t6i6o). Each language folder contains a network file (".in", detailing the structure of the neural network), example files (".ex", detailing the information presented to the network for training), weight files (".wt.bz2", providing the learned weight values of the network at three points during training; see report for details on why certain timepoints were used, p 84-85), and an error report (.png, showing the decline in error over training). The .in and .ex files can be used to re-run training, or the .wt.bz2 files can be used to forego training (which took several weeks) and move on to network testing and analyses. 

The second folder, "testing", includes the network structure used for testing (explain diffs from training here), as well as example files used for testing at 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 "ticks" (a Lens unit for network time) of prime exposure. The example file structures for 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 ticks, which were also used in the report, can be extrapolated if required, but were excluded for the sake of storage space. "wts2outs.tcl" automates the procedure for testing the network on all example files, using weights from all selected time points from training. "outs.zip" contains 15 .out files providing activation values of the hidden and output layers over the course of each testing example, in effect characterizing the network's response to testing examples at different points in training. Outputs are provided for the 5 example files included, across the three chosen training points. 

The third folder, "analyses", TO COMPLETE. 

The fourth folder, "report", contains only the 14th chapter of my dissertation, which explains and describes this simulation work as well as its motivation in detail. For more context, see my dissertation repository for all chapters.
